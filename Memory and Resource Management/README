
To compile: type 'make' into the terminal when inside the project directory named A3
To run: to run the first program type: './dine (num philosophers) (num eat time)' where you decide what the 2 variables are
	to run the second program type './holes assets/testfile1' or include a testfile of your own. 

About dine.c: 
	This program uses concurrent programming concepts to solve the dining philosophers problem. 

About holes.c:
	Was unable to complete this program. Only attempted the first fit. 

Known Limitations: The second program does not work fully. Had a bug in my runningHead queue. 

Test code: 

****TEST 1*****
This test is testing 4 philosphers at the table, where each philsopher eats exactly 3 times before the program exits. 

Some sample output for dining philsophers.
A3$ make
gcc -o dine dine.c -pthread
gcc -o holes holes.c
A3$ ./dine 4 3
