Compilation: 'make' with no quotes

To run: './msh' with no quotes

Known Limitations: The command & will return immdediatly but an enter key press is needed before the next command is set

References: The lex file provided is used to parse the input while inside the shell

Disclamer: This is a shell implementation in C. The functions I have implemented
            are the cd command, the arg command, the exit command, the add command,
            the ??? command which i decided to call face which prints a face to stdout. The exit command ends the program.
            Also the rest of the implemented calls are system calls like date, time, xemacs, cat, ect...
