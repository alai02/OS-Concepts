Compilation: 'make' with no quotes

To run: './msh' with no quotes

Known Limitations: The command & will return immdediatly but an enter key press is needed before the next command is set

References: The lex file provided is used to parse the input while inside the shell

Disclamer: This is a shell implementation in C. The functions I have implemented
            are the cd command, the arg command (as seen in the spec), the exit command, the add command( as seen in the spec),
            the ??? command which i decided to call face which prints a face to stdout(as seen in the spec). The exit command just ends the program.
            The rest of the implemented calls are system calls like date, time, xemacs, cat, ect...
            Since the spec is extremely vague in waht is needed for the implementation
            the shell may not be complete as the full unix shell has many more features.
