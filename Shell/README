DISCLAMER: This is a shell implementation in C. Note the assignment compiles with warning but that is not my code,
            the code provided by the professor has warnings in the code and have nothing to do with my solution so
            no marks should be lost for that as I am assuming the professor knows his code has warnings(assumption). The makefile
            provided was changed and also extra flags were added to lex.c to remove some warnings. The functions I have implemented
            are the cd command, the arg command (as seen in the spec), the exit command, the add command( as seen in the spec),
            the ??? command which i decided to call face which prints a face to stdout(as seen in the spec). The exit command just ends the program.
            The rest of the implemented calls are system calls like date, time, xemacs, cat, ect...
            Since the spec is extremely vague in waht is needed for the implementation
            the shell may not be complete as the full unix shell has many more features.

Compilation: 'make' with no quotes
To run: './msh' with no quotes
Known Limitations: The command & will return immdediatly but an enter key press is needed before the next command is set
References: The lex file provided is used to parse the input while inside the shell
